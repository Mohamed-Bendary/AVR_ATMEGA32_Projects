This Reposatory shows my work in full embedded systems diploma on AVR by IMT

The Reposatory contains MCAL / HAL drivers and Smart home project

Smart Home project short description:

Interfacing with AVR (ATMEGA32) to interact with sensors and HW for home control like: 
• LCD & Keypad: To implement password algorithm for user entering the home
• IR sensor: To automatically turn on the lamp when user opening the door and close on his exit
• Thermostat: Measure the home temperature to switch off the lamp & turn on the fan if the home in autonomous 
• Smoke sensor: To detect high smoke intensity to switch the fan to push it out
• Bluetooth module (BLE) with GUI to transfer the data from and to the user to control the home from 
 autonomous control or manual.
